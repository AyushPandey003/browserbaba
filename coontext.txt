# **The Blueprint**

You've explored the vision. Now, here is a framework to help you think about the engineering challenges and showcase your skills. A truly great "second brain" excels across these four dimensions.

**Core Expectations:**

Your final submission should consist of three demonstrable components:

1. **(Must Have) A Web Application:** The core interface for your users.
2. **(Could Have)A Browser Extension:** For effortless capture.
3. **(Could Have) An MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) Server:** An endpoint for third-party AI integrations.

**Dimension 1: Speed & Reliability**

A "second brain" that is slow or loses data is useless. Your system must feel instantaneous and be utterly reliable.

- **Challenge:** Content ingestion (scraping, AI analysis) can be slow and prone to failure. How does your system handle saving a large, complex article without making the user wait? What happens if a website is down or blocks your system? A great system can process multiple items in the background and gracefully handles failures, so the user experience is always fast and smooth.

**Dimension 2: Seamless Data Collection**

The power of Synapse grows with every piece of information it contains. The easier it is to add data, the more powerful it becomes.

- **Challenge:** How do you make saving content from anywhere truly effortless? The **Browser Extension** is a key part of this. But think bigger: the **MCP Server** is your chance to design a platform. What is the data 'contract' an external AI should use to send you data? How can you make that integration secure, simple, and powerful for all users?

**Dimension 3: A Rich & Adaptive User Experience**

Your application should feel like a visual, interactive extension of your mind, not a spreadsheet.

- **Challenge:** A list of links is not enough. How does your interface adapt to different types of content? A saved book should look like a book. A recipe should be immediately usable. How do you present a saved article in a clean, focused **"reader mode"**? The user experience for both visualizing and retrieving data is paramount.

**Dimension 4: Search Intelligence** 

This is the heart of the project. Your goal is to make search feel like a conversation with an intelligent assistant. Revisit the queries from the first document—your success will be measured by how many of these your system can answer.

- **Challenge:** *"that quote about new beginnings from the handwritten note I saved"*
    - **Think About:** How can your system find text that isn't on a webpage, but locked inside a saved image or a screenshot?
- **Challenge:** *"what Karpathy said about tokenization in that paper?"*
    - **Think About:** A simple keyword search will fail here. How can your system understand the *meaning* and *context* of the full article to find the exact passage the user is thinking of?
- **Challenge:** *"articles about AI agents I saved last month"*
    - **Think About:** How can your search bar distinguish between keywords (AI agents), content types (articles), and timeframes (last month) in a single, natural language query?

### **Chart Your Own Course**

These dimensions are a guide, not a rigid checklist. They represent opportunities to showcase your skills. If a particular aspect of this problem sparks an idea—a novel user interface, a unique AI capability, or a clever architectural pattern—we encourage you to pursue it.

While innovation is celebrated, a functional, end-to-end prototype that delivers on the core experience is the ultimate goal. The more complete and polished your final product is, the better.

Let us know what you're building and why you think it's important. Good luck, and we're excited to see what you create.
